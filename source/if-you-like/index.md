His blog frequently features short stories, and interesting write ups about clever game design.

#### [The Cistercian-Trappist Monastery of Our Lady of Calvary](https://www.calvaryabbey.com/weekly-chronicle/)

Daily updates from the Trappist Monks at a monastery in New Brunswick, Canada. It's the best blog on the internet.

Matt is the founder of write.as, administrator of writing.exchange, and otherwise cool guy. His blog is tech-focused regarding the problems he's currently facing, so if you like my blog, you'll like his.

Locomalito is a Spanish game designer who makes difficult, unique Arcade Games reminiscint of his childhood. Most of them are free, all of them are very good, and his writing about his design process is fascinating.

## Videographers / YouTube Channels

#### [nana825763](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr1zZcrgK3k-KvH5KnfHtXQ)

nana825763 became famous on the Creepy Pasta scene for the terrifying video he titled [My house walk-through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWXnt2Z2D1E), and the follow up video where he shows the effort he went through in order to make it. He is also doing a Minecraft Playthrough, which he went into with absolutely no knowledge of how the game works.

#### [u m a m i](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqrrxZeeFSNCjGmD-33SKMw)

A Canadian music producer and animator, umami is writing, animating, show running, and composing for the fantastic series [Interface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHqsCmfTDmI), a story about a man who cannot die and a creature called Mischief in an alternate-future (past?) Montreal. I discovered the [soundtrack](https://hexsystem.bandcamp.com/album/interface-ost-vol-i)before I found the series, and it's amazing to think it's all done by one man.

#### [SulMatul](https://www.youtube.com/user/SulMatul)

SulMatul does fantastic video essays on the deeper side of video game design, like ["Heroism in Futility"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPKHRzSpbqQ), an essay about the cult-classic Russian games *Pathologic* and *The Void* (both of which are near and dear to my heart), or a commentary on [Victimhood within LISA.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jT7tmU0hMY)

#### [The Minute Hour](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7k7WPHxxBZM145BX_SKDwQ)

Insane, improvised, one-man comedy skits in audio format - with a handful of animations as well. The Minute Hour is the king of quick, clever humor in dumb contexts.
