I subscribed to [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/) a while ago. They had a promo available where the print/online combo was cheaper then just subscribing to the paper edition, so I gave it a shot. 

Canada Post is notoriously slow with any delivery, and no mail will ever arrive at a routine, predictable time, so my hope was that I'd be able to read the magazine exactly on its publishing date and then deep-read the paper copy when it eventually arrived. <!--more-->

Imagine how plussed I was to discover that my digital subscription just lifts the article-cap off the website, which does not include every single article in the print magazine.

There is a dedicated app that offers the full magazine - as far as I can tell, at least - for iOS, but If you have Android, tough love.

Google Play Newstand offers a nice mobile UI for the website, but, again, you're still missing articles.

This brings me into a larger topic, that being: Why don't News Publishers understand the internet? Most of them, from your local fish-wrap all the way to massive publications like *Vogue* or *Wired*, outsource their digital publications - their website, digital subscriptions, etc. - to external providers like [*PressPad*](https://xww.ro/?https://www.presspadapp.com/) or [*Magzter*](https://xww.ro/?https://www.magzter.com/), companies who - A, don't spend a lot of time making sure the digital version looks great, and B, don't really give two shits about customer service.

All I want is a readable, digital magazine, like [issuu](https://xww.ro/?https://issuu.com/) does. I want to turn pages, scroll around, and zoom in on text. It doesn't have to be perfectly optimized for my phone - that's not what matters. What matters is I'm getting the same information as the print publication, because if I'm not, I feel ripped off.

It's no  secret in the world of journalism that the budgets are getting smaller and newspapers are dying. I feel a major portion of this crunch is from the inability for publications to get with the times. Spend some money, New Yorker! Hire some designers to build you a proper digital magazine. Hack the Planet!
