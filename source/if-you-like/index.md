## Videographers / YouTube Channels

#### [nana825763](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr1zZcrgK3k-KvH5KnfHtXQ)

nana825763 became famous on the Creepy Pasta scene for the terrifying video he titled [My house walk-through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWXnt2Z2D1E). He's an extremly talented Japanese prop designer and filmographer, who riles you up with his terrifying videos, then unveils how he made them to calm you down, like a magician after a particuarily terrifying stunt.

He is also doing a Minecraft Playthrough, which he went into with absolutely zero knowledge of the game. It's a fun contrast to his usual uploads.

#### [u m a m i](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqrrxZeeFSNCjGmD-33SKMw)

A Canadian music producer and animator, umami is writing, animating, show running, and composing for the fantastic series [Interface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHqsCmfTDmI), a story about a man who cannot die and a creature called Mischief in an alternate-future (past?) Montreal. I discovered the [soundtrack](https://hexsystem.bandcamp.com/album/interface-ost-vol-i)before I found the series, and it's amazing to think it's all done by one man.

#### [LOCAL58](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuoMasRkMhlj1VNVAOJdw5w)

LOCAL 58 is a series of Horror Vignettes about a fictional public-access television station and the strange things that get broadcast at night. It's made by Krist Straub, writer of the well-loved creepypasta [Candle Cove](http://ichorfalls.chainsawsuit.com/), and the webcomic [Broodhollow](http://broodhollow.chainsawsuit.com/).

#### [Jonni Phillips](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1NbRaGNot6kNEL3Jsa7SRA)

Jonni is an animator and cartoonist, known for her strange shorts, claymation work, and the film [The Final Exit of the Disciples of Ascensia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KfuFPlzEYc).

#### [SulMatul](https://www.youtube.com/user/SulMatul)

SulMatul does fantastic video essays on the deeper side of video game design, like ["Heroism in Futility"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPKHRzSpbqQ), an essay about the cult-classic Russian games *Pathologic* and *The Void* (both of which are near and dear to my heart), or a commentary on [Victimhood within LISA.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jT7tmU0hMY)

#### [The Minute Hour](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7k7WPHxxBZM145BX_SKDwQ)

Insane, improvised, one-man comedy skits in audio format - with a handful of animations as well. The Minute Hour is the king of quick, clever humor in dumb contexts.
